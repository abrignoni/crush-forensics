"""RawImageVFS on XFS, Btrfs and ReFS volumes.

The images and their listings are abrignoni/qnxprobe's own MIT-licensed test
fixtures (tests/fixtures at the vendored commit), renamed with a `raw_`
prefix:

- `raw_xfs` is xfs-v5-4kn: mkfs.xfs wrote it from a source tree (4 KiB
  sectors, the metadata directory). `raw_xfs.known.json.gz` is its listing
  and the sha256 of every file, taken from the source tree.
- `raw_btrfs` is btrfs-zlib: mkfs.btrfs --rootdir wrote it, zlib-compressed,
  from a source tree. `raw_btrfs.sha256` is btrfs.src.sha256, the sha256 of
  every file in that tree.
- `raw_refs` is refs-fixture: a Windows 11 ReFS 3.14 volume of which only the
  bytes the reader reads are kept, each at its own offset (qnxprobe's
  tools/make_refs_fixture.py), so it is read through qnxprobe's own reader
  for that layout, not opened as an image file. `raw_refs.known.tsv.gz` is
  what Windows reported about each file and stream while the volume was
  mounted. The content of the files the fixture leaves out by name is not
  checked.
